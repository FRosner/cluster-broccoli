## Description

Cluster Broccoli is a RESTful web service + UI to manage [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) jobs through a self service application. Jobs are defined based on templates, allowing for a selectable amount of customization.

If you want to give your end users the possibility to create new instances of live demos of your product, while allowing them to customize it (e.g. using an embedded database or an external one, number of cores, ...) - Cluster Broccoli is for you.

Cluster Broccoli is meant to be setup by your IT. Some technical knowledge is required to setup the infrastructure and define the templates. End users can be internal (QA, data scientists) or external (customers, potential customers).

## Usage

### Web UI

Cluster Broccoli comes with a minimalistic web user interface. It allows you to create, destroy, start and stop your instances based on a set of predefined templates. Please consult the documenation for a [detailed description of the Web UI](https://github.com/FRosner/cluster-broccoli/wiki/Web-UI).
